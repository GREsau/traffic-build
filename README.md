## Required Components

### Raspberry Pi Zero W

The specific model of Raspberry Pi is mostly irrelevant. I've chosen the Zero W for its small form factor and out-of-the-box connectivity options, requiring less wiring for administration.


### ModMyPi PiOT Relay Board

The lights will run off a standard 240v 3-pin lead. That kind of voltage would kill the Pi, so a relay is used to separate the micro-controller power circuit from the light power circuit. A Relay is a switch, controlled by the GPIO pins on the Pi, allowing the Pi to turn on and off the lights.

This board is particularly nice as the Pi Zero W can mount directly on top of it!

As this board will be dealing with life-threatening amount of current, safety is paramount. The unit will be encased in an insulated enclosure before any power is passed through the relay switches.

### Raspberry Pi Zero Male Header - 40 Pin (2 x 20)

The Raspberry Pi Zero series doesn't come with any GPIO pins, only holes. This header will be soldered to the Pi Zero W and will allow it to easily slot into the GPIO ports on the relay board.

### M2.5 Mounting Screws and Nuts

These are to more securely mount the Pi Zero W to the relay board.
